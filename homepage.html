      <h1>Project Description</h1>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">We chose a Deep-Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic setup for this project since its simplicity would be more approachable for the novice home gardener.
	  In DWC systems, the plantâ€™s roots are directly submerged in water, which maximizes nutrient absorption.
	  Additionally, an air pump oxygenates the water from the bottom of the reservoir through an air stone or diffuser that provides an even distribution of oxygen throughout the system.
	   The desired pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) levels are determined based on the type of plants being grown and would require minimal online research to find the appropriate levels for optimal growth.</p>
